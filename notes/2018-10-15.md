# Done today
* Catch up post our engineering all hands week
* Work around supporting rollups for ML.
   * This included https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34200
   * And some investigation into https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34379 which may be easier than I first thought. It comes down to where to put the default values if no aggs are defined for the timefield in the datehistogram grouping. It could be external to the RollupJobConfig, but since the value is updated in the config, it may make sense to have it set on construction.
* Work on documenting all that is done with our end of bucket processing in the C++ codebase
   [x] Persistence of model and quantiles
   [x] Updates of memory statistics and pruning
   [ ] Model updates // this is the most difficult to distill

# TILs
Some pretty interesting technical talks coming out of Strange loop over the last couple of days:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yneJIxOdMX4 Hilarious talk given by Janelle Shane. Great overview of "AI" failures and "deep" neural nets. Fully generalizing ML models and democratizing the results is a hard, unsolved problem.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwLBNzxKjM Informative talk about data pipelines and their pains by Elijah ben Izzy. All the plumbing around the ML model that makes it production ready is incredibly difficult to scale, test, and ship. This talk goes over some of the pains, and how 2Sigma has solved them internally.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDMJr0h5_xw Wes Chow speaks on building a topic detection system. Some folks on top of the Elastic Stack have built similar systems using anomaly detection and the significant terms aggregation. Elastic seems to have many of these buildblocks already in the stack and just pulling them all together well would provide a nice product.
