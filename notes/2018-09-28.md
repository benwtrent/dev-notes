* Opened a PR for https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34159
* Continued work on https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31999
   * Well, initial work on matching up aggregators is completed, not too bad
   * There is an issue around how we build out datafeed aggregations. Right now, we require a `max` aggregation on the time field used in the `date_histogram` in the datafeed aggregation definition. However, when searching a rollup index, we include that `max` call. This makes sense on traditional indexes as we want the timestamp of the bucket in the datafeed to be the largest timestamp in that window. The issue arises because rollup indexes need to have the aggregation metrics defined for future desired searches, and you currently cannot have a `date` type used in a metric field. Going to talk to some other folks on the ML team and the Rollup team to see if we can figure out which of the follow options work best.
      * Support `date` in the metric fields in rollup
      * Remove `max` timestamp aggregation in the datafeed configuration before streaming in the data to the ML job.
