# Done today
* More work and investigation into rollup index support for datafeeds
   * My initial stab only covered a specific path where users were providing a wildcard that included a rollup index and a live index.
   * When supplying just a rollup index, Chunking and baseline searching breaks. Need to discuss with others on the best way to address the chunking issue. 
   * Additionally, my validations of the rollup jobs required a capability overlap between all the configurations, which is not how rollups really work. I should have instead determined if ANY rollup job configured for the captured rollup index had the capabilities to support the datafeed aggregation.
