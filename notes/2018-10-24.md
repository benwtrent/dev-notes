# Done today:
* Reverted poorly written code that did not take into account BWC: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34815
   * If we were in a mixed versioned cluster, and one of the nodes did not support `date` fields in rollups yet (pre v6.5) that job would blow up. 
   * Additionally, existing jobs could have been unintentially modified as the default settings could have modified existing jobs being (de)serialized.
* Opened a new PR taking these two issues into account after the reverting was completed: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34831
* Before the BWC panic in trying to get the revert commit into 6.5, I did get some studying done for the certification exam
