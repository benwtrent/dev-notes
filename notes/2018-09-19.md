Downloading google certs
```
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect googleapis.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > googleapiscert.cert
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect accounts.google.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > googleaccounts.cert
```

`git pull upstream --rebase` is the way to go, keep shared branches clean
