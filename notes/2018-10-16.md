# Done today

* Finally got https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34200 merged and done
* This opened the door for fixing https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34379
* Opened the PR for https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34534
   * This is a tad tricky as WHERE the default values should be set and if they should be part of the config is up for debate. I think making it plain to the end user what default values are set, and making them part of the config is the simpliest and most open solution. Though we ocould just intercept the capabilities and aggregations to include the necessary defaults, though this seems like overkill for little to now benefit.
* Opened the PR https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34538
   * Lazy nodes would be a nice win.
   * It proved to be more difficult to accomplish than previously thought and I am not even sure I completely covered my bases. Waiting on discussion and review with other team members to make sure this change is good.
