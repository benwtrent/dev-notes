# Done today
* Finished and merged https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34538
   * This was a pretty neat change as with this slight change, jobs can be created and opened and THEN a node be added to the cluster
* Finished https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34534
   * This was the last blocker for the ML datafeed updates to support rollups.
   * Also got to test setting up and deploying a specific snapshot build to the cloud. Provided good learning around gcp
* Started studying more for the elastic certification test. Forcing myself to go through the certification process provides myself a goal that also improves my knowledge of the stack.

# TIL

* SSH into gcloud vm: `gcloud compute --project "<project>" ssh --zone "<zone-name>" "<vm-name>"`
* SCP into a gcloud vm: `gcloud compute scp /local/file/path <vm-name>:/destination/file/path`
   * This specific command format requires the default zone to be set `gcloud config set compute/zone <zone-name`
   * Listing zones: `gcloud compute zones list`
