# Done today
* Finally finished the PR for: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34654
   * There were some previously overlooked logic in our data chunking configurations and how they interact with aggregations.
   * This in particular took a fair bit of time to get right but the end result is much better

# TIL
* Douglas Hofstadter's talk about Machine Translations was excelent and added context for me around the difficulties in translating between languages well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xnr-ST6ITo
* Elasticsearch transport layer does not necessarily guaruntee which node will take care of a requested internal action. Consequently, if you add a field to a streamable class but do not add that field to the stream, it could be missing once the action completes and you get your result. It COULD work if the system guarunteed the completion would happen on the same node and thus short-circuit the serialization. But, better safe than sorry.
